    Hi! I am a Masters student at Stanford University and a researcher in the Stanford Natural Language Processing Group. My current research pursuits fall somewhere in the realm of machine learning and natural language understanding. I build dialogue agents, especially of the goal-oriented variety, and in the past I have worked on computational semantics and textual inference. <br> <br>
I also have a soft spot for brains, and hope to one day merge my interest in computational neuroscience and the cognitive sciences, and my fascination with natural language. <br> <br>

As someone whose academic career has been enriched by the many amazing courses, books, and materials made available by educators, I am a strong believer in sharing knowledge and intuitive pedagogy. In the past, I have been a teaching assistant at Stanford for the following courses:

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106a/"> CS106A (Programming Methodology) </a></li>
    <li><a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106b/">CS106B (Programming Abstractions)</a> </li>
    <li><a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/">CS224N (Natural Language Processing)</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs109/">CS109 (Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists)</a></li>

</ul>
